Practice: React Movie App

===== INSTRUCTIONS =====
You will create a simple React application where users can:
1. Select a movie genre from a dropdown menu.
2. See a list of movies based on the selected genre.
3. View a loading message while the app "fetches" movie data.
4. Display an error message if no genre is selected and the user tries to fetch data.

Steps:
1. Initial Setup
    ● Create a React app.
    ● Create a component named MovieSelector.
2. Requirements
    ● Use state to manage:
        ○ selectedGenre (string): Tracks the currently selected genre.
        ○ isLoading (boolean): Indicates if the app is "loading" movie data.
        ○ error (string): Stores error messages, if any.
        ○ movies (array): Holds the list of movies for the selected genre.
3. Functionality
    ● Dropdown menu to select a genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
    ● Button to "Fetch Movies" for the selected genre.
    ● Display a list of movies after "fetching."
    ● Show a loading spinner while fetching data.
    ● Display an error message if no genre is selected.
